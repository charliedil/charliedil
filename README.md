- 👋 Hi, I’m @nehadil
- 👀 I’m interested in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Data Science.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on Unsupervised Named-Entity Recognition using clustering algorithms.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, although this could change in the future! Very focused on NER right now.
- 📫 You can reach me at ndil@vcu.edu
